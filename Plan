Does the pose pose of a speaker contribute the identification as speaker?
1. crop the bounding box to select the active speaker and then compute openpose based on the cropped image
2. Read the entire frame, compute openpose and use the bounding box information to extract the active speaker

compare 1 and 2

- compute the eucledean distance bw one frame and the other
- compute the eu................ bw keypoint 1 and 8 ( normalization regarding persion trunck)
- we will keep the face keypoint in case we need more data later.

Issues:
1. The  bbox does not always intersect the region of interest (face) based on the coordinates from csv
2. 

Statistics:
Counted: 17,781 None: 16,224

the active speaker moves the upper body more than the non active speaker
analysis of the frames with (trunk lenght or not) eg. 80% of the frames have no trunck lenght

1. I have modified the initial way we save frames from videos by multiplying the frame_timestamp by 1000(milli seconds) and this gives the exact
reference frame.

The Euclideanc distance alone is not enough for the measuing how much a person moves
therefore, we propose using a cosin measre to measure the angular distance

instead of musing the ed
we calculate the diff the pos one frame and another frame
