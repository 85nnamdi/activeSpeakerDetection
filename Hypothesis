Does the pose pose of a speaker contribute the identification as speaker?
1. crop the bounding box to select the active speaker and then compute openpose based on the cropped image
2. Read the entire frame, compute openpose and use the bounding box information to extract the active speaker

compare 1 and 2

- compute the eucledian distance bw one frame and the other
- compute the eu................ bw keypoint 0 and 8
- we will keep the face keypoint in case we need more data later.
